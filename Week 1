PROMPT
Briefly describe the context for the visual by addressing the following questions: 

1.What is the source of the visual? (e.g., URL or bibliographic citation)
2.Who is the intended audience (i.e., decoders)? How do you know this?

Intended Audience: This article addresses to scientists primarily and secondly to the public people. 
This one has been published in a scientific website, while this website is full of graphs.

PROMPT

1.Identify the specific component(s) of the visual that is/are misleading

2.For each part(s) of the visualization that is/are misleading, identify the mechanism that is used: hiding
relevant data to highlight what benefits us; displaying too much data to obscure reality; using graphic 
forms in inappropriate ways (distorting the data)

3.Explain how the mechanisms are used to mislead

Component 1: Diagrams Mechanism: Distorting the data
Explanation: The plotted diagrams surely have a correlation but they represent two different sizes .
It seems from the y-axis . Parts per million and millions of tons in the secondary and primary axes.

Component2: Y-axis.
Mechanism: Distorting the data.
Explanation: Seeing these diagrams hastily someone may think that both plots tend to zero for 1750. 
But this is not true for atmospheric CO2. It is knowh that CO2 is not only produced by humans.

Component3: X-axis.
Mechanism: Hiding relevant data.
Explanation: We may think that CO2 emssions starts from the industrial revolution. 
But how do we know that in 1500 atmospheric CO2 was not higher than 1810?
